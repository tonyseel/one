Is repairing credit score problems just one big headache for you? Do you find yourself cringing at the thought of answering the phone with another collection agency chasing and pestering you. Do you hate the thought of the time it will take to fix it. It's enough to make anyone scream!

Fear not. If you want to rebuild your credit and get those collection agencies off your back, then read on for the monthly steps that take 3 hours or less of your time in repairing credit score trouble.

This powerful method is used whether the listed negative is correct or not. Dispute one unique item from below list and in that order for each negative listing per month. Create one dispute letter. Save it and reuse the letter, but change to the next item before sending. The bureau must prove the information is correct within 30 days. There is a 70-75% chance that one of the items below will be unverifiable. 

1. This isn't my account
2. I wasn't late that month
3. This is wrong amount owed
4. Bad account number
5. Not the original creditor
6. Incorrect balance owed
7. Incorrect credit limit
8. Incorrect status
9. Incorrect highest credit amount used
10. Here is what you do on the same day each month:

Month 1: 

- Get a free copy of your credit report.
- Write a dispute letter to credit bureaus for each negative, starting with first item from above list.
- Make a copy of letters and send via US Mail certified, return receipt requested.
- Collect/file Credit Bureau responses as they come in as you prepare for repairing credit score difficulties.

Month 2 and each month after: 

- Review each response.
- If bureau can't prove. Celebrate and your done with that one negative.
- If bureau proves, go to next dispute item from above list and write another dispute letter to bureau for each remaining negative.
- Also, for each negative not removed, write a dispute letter to originating agency listing the negative. They also have 30 days to respond and show proof that the listing is correct, or must remove the listing by law. If the listing is over 12-18 months, they likely will not have any records in which to prove the information.
- Make a copy of letters and send via US Mail certified, return receipt requested.

While there are many strategies for repairing credit score problems, this method works extremely well if you are not in a hurry. You have a 70-75% chance that they'll not be able to prove each negative listing and will have to remove it.

Regaining control of your credit rating is critical to your success. Putting a solid plan in place for Repairing Credit Score difficulties is the best way to regain control.
